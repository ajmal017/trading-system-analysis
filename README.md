Sharpe Index, Risk Reward, Profit Factor, Kelly Criterion and the Edge of a trading system. 

## About this Project

This project is an implementation of some metrics used to evaluate the quality of a trading system. 

## Getting Started

The following tests were implemented: 

- **Kelly Criterion** - The Kelly Criterion is a money-management formula that calculates the optimal amount you should bet when there's a difference between the true odds and the given odds. 

- **Sharpe Index** - In finance, the Sharpe ratio measures the performance of an investment compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk.

- **Risk Reward** - The risk/reward ratio marks the prospective reward an investor can earn, for every dollar he or she risks on an investment. 

- **Trading Edge** - A trading edge in the financial markets can be described as a set of conditions that when present, give a higher probability of a trade working than not working.

- **Profit Factor** - The profit factor is defined as the gross profit divided by the gross loss (including commissions) for the entire trading period.

### Files

In the project directory there is one Jupyter notebook where the code is written. 

### Running the code

To run this project you should have a local server running with Jupyter Notebook installed (you can use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/))

The Jupyter notebook is filled with two types of cells, markdown and, code. To run the cells press shift + return and then check the results if there is any to be shown.

To run the analysis, you should have a CSV with the results of the trades you want to test. The CSV must contain only one cell with the result in points of each trade. 

### Built With 

[Python Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - To manage csv files 

[Numpy](https://numpy.org/)

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
